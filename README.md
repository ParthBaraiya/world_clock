## Future Plans:
- Add feature to compare two or more timezones side by side.
- Add feature to search the timezone from the list of timezones based on timezone abbr and 
  location name.
- Add feature to sort timezones based on location(ASC or DESC), timezone(ASC or DESC), and 
  offset(More to Less or vice versa).

### NOTE:
- In this version we are removing timeline view from the app to focus on core functionalities. 
  we will add it in the code once all the core functionalities are implemented.
